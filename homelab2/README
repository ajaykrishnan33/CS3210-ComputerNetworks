Instructions for running:

fileserver:
	Within server folder:
		make
		./tcpfileserver <portno>
	Within client folder:
		make
		./tcpfileclient localhost <portno>

mathlab:
	make
	For running the server: ./udpmathserver <portno>
	For running the client: ./udpclient localhost <portno>

I referred to the sample code uploaded on moodle for building the tcp and udp client/server.
